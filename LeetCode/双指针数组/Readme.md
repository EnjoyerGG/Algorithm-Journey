Hooray! when dealing with Array and LinkedList questions, two pointers skills are commonly applied.<br>
Including both <span style="color: green;"><strong>fast-slow</strong></span> and <span style="color: red;"><strong>left-right</strong></span>.<br>

Q26，Q27，Q283 are about "modifying Array without ruining the structure".<br><br>

All the questions based on Array, similar to yxc's ides ;)
